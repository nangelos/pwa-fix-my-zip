This is an app that allows cities to crowd-source their reporting of issues that need to be fixed in each neighborhood. We all want smooth roads and street lights that work, now with Fix My Zip it's as easy as taking a picture on your phone.

Fix My Zip interacts with users cameras and geolocation, allowing them to take pictures of infrastructural improvements that need to be made in their city. See a pothole? Report it to the city by taking your phone out of your pocket, snapping a picture and uploading it to the database. Burned out street light? Ditto.
